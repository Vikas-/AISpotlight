# Large Language Models and Agentic Systems

**LLMs** are evolving rapidly. At their core, they are systems designed to generate text based on prompts. Trained on extensive datasets, they excel at producing coherent and contextually relevant outputs. However they come with a few limitations: 

- **Knowledge cutoff**: LLMs lack access to the latest information, as their training data has a fixed knowledge cutoff date.
- **Reasoning ability**: Most popular LLMS currently struggle with advanced reasoning capabilities.

**Agentic systems** helps us get around these limitations to build consumer-facing applications.

Agentic systems are built around LLMs and are enhanced with:
- Tools
- Memory
- Data retrieval capabilities

They vary significantly, ranging from **autonomous systems** that operate independently to return results, to **human-orchestrated systems** designed to assist with specific tasks.

Most agentic systems fall into two primary categories:
- **Workflows**
- **Agents**
